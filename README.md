# RAG_using_llamaindex
This repo provides implementation of RAG(Retrieval Augmented generation) using LlamaIndex


Here we used LlamaIndex Framework, OpenAI's GPT-3  and an open source llm model to query over our documents.


Note: I have used LLmaIndex documentation to develop code, so some of the code has been used from the documentation.
Below is the link to LLamaindex docs.

Place your docs in "data" folder and run the file to converse with the bot.
